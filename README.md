# House Price Prediction Project(Linear Regression Project) 

---

## Overview
PRODIGY ML Task 1 is a hands-on project demonstrating the full machine learning workflow. It covers **data exploration**, **preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model building**, and **evaluation** to predict [target variable, e.g., house prices] using regression techniques.

---

## Highlights
- Comprehensive **data analysis** with visualizations  
- Robust **data cleaning** and preprocessing  
- **Feature engineering** for improved predictions  
- Predictive modeling using **Linear Regression** and other ML algorithms  
- **Model evaluation** with RMSE and R² metrics  
- Step-by-step workflow in **Jupyter Notebook**  

---

## Setup & Usage
### Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ and essential libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## Running the Project
## Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/KrishShah1912/PRODIGY-ML-TASK-1.git```

---

## Open ML1.ipynb in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook
* Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the results
* Model Evaluation
* Models are evaluated using:
  -RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures prediction error
  -R² Score: Shows how well the model explains variance in the data

## Acknowledgments
* Dataset from [source, e.g., Kaggle “House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques”]
* Some guidance generated with AI tools

---

## License
Open for learning, experimentation, and portfolio use.
